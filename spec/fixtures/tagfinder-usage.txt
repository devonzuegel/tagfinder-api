usage:
to search for tag patterns and filter out tandem LC-MS data not associated with tag patterns
   bin/tagfinder-mac input_file.mzxml
to do the same using non-default settings
   bin/tagfinder-mac input_file.mzxml configuration_file
to generate a configuration file at default settings
   bin/tagfinder-mac -g config_file

Note that output will go in to files with names based upon the 
input mxzml files name, with the ".mzxml" removed and various
postfixes added on for different types of output.
input_file_summary.txt - summary of tag patterns found and a record of the settings the program was run at
input_file_chart.txt - table of tag patterns found, sorted by score
input_file_massspec.csv - intended for use as input to an LC-MS machine for 2nd stage experiments; generally a subset of the information in input_file_chart.txt
input_file_filtered.mzxml - mzxml with non-matching MS2 data removed
input_file_filter_log.txt - listing of why each MS2 scan was passed or rejected
input_file_filter_log2.txt - briefer listing
